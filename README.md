This project demonstrates my ability to use CAST statements in SQL server to identify varchar(max) data type as decimal and integers. I had uploaded the whole data type as varchar(max) and used CSV Files instead of MS Excel Workbook for smoother operations. Then I analyzed the data of Covid of the worldwide population and got to understand the use of SUM, Average, Divison, MAX and other functions such as Group BY, LIKE Statements,  Order BY etc.  to gain valuable insights of data associated with Covid 19.
